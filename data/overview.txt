A smart-edge network
with Intrinsic Data Integrity

Part I
A Smart-edge Network

Before the web
• Information users and information

consumers mostly trapped in the same
silos, with limited interconnection

Before the web
AOL client

Prodigy client

AOL Content

e-mail

Prodigy

the web
• Creates a network by separation of

functions: It splits client and content.

• Resource information consumers are not

confined to a silo of information producers.

• Radical growth in client and content
makers

the web
Pushes Intelligence to the edges, which:

• Drives innovation in clients
• Drives innovation in content
• Drives emergence: simple brochures site,

news, blogs, twitter, semantic web, google,
wikipedia, etc..

• Distributes power into many hands

cc systems today
• One-stop shopping
• Usually a single web-site with integrated
marketplace

• Some some integration with other input
modalities (sms, phone)

meta-currency network
Pushes Intelligence to the edges, which:

• Drives innovation in clients
• Drives innovation in currency design
• Drives emergence... yet to be seen
• Distributes power into many hands

Technical Infrastructure
The Web:
•
•

a simple interaction pattern (protocol):
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
a set of standard formats for specifying resources:
HTML, XML, jpg, png, Javascript...

The Meta-currency Network:
•
•

an interaction pattern (protocol):
Meta-Currency Protocol (MCP)
a set of standard formats for specifying currency types and
transactions in those currencies

Part II
Intrinsic Data Integrity

Today’s security model
Integrity through strength
Data is safe from
corruption by
strong walls
Power is in the
hands of wall
builders

Balances
Account Holder
Information
Transaction
Histories

Intrinsic Data Integrity
Security through structure
Data is safe from
corruption by being
embedded in an
incorruptible context
Power is in the
hands of currency
users

Balance =
encrypted value +
signature + link to
previous signed balance
Transaction =
encrypted transaction
+ signature + link to
previous signed
transaction
