(Great stuff, I'm glad you're still thinking about this, because I have.
 Probably the closest I came to a calculation was my example of a bakery I
 gave in the google group forum. I guess I'm better at addressing specific
 scenarios, and giving a narrative answer.

 Perhaps a good development exercise would be this:
 -propose a scenario that can illustrate the way OFCS would be applied,
 and/or test its underlying theory
 -I will respond the best I can
 -you review my answer for errors or discrepancies
 - after revision, I will boil it down to a use-case scenario
 - the use-cases will be the foundation of a software requirements
 specification)

 Regulating Syndicate

 Relations

 Utilitarian Concerns

 Transparent

 all users, including all personally identifiable details are available to all other members of the syndicate.

 CreditComplexity

 Simplified => "all value is quantified in a single unit system. This precludes dynamic pricing.",
 Multiple => "all debits and credits include multiple values, such as carbon emissions, labor time, and energy.",

 When a credit syndicate becomes untenable, unstable,
 or inactive due to neglect, it may be necessary to
 dissolve the syndicate. Dissolution itself is not
 complex, but a process for distribution and
 transference of all indebted goods must be laid out
 beforehand to prevent disputes.  +

 If two syndicates wish to merge their economies,
 there are several options: they can either keep
 their separate credit unit systems, create a new
 system from scratch, or transfer all of one credit
 system into the other.

 Dissolution itself is not complex, but a process for distribution and
 transference of all indebted goods must be laid out beforehand to
 prevent disputes.

 ComputeBalances

 Automated checks of individual accounts can occur
 continuously, adjusting for variable rates in the
 market. For example, GHG sequestering may vary in
 labor costs, which will dynamically affect the balance
 of an individual who has GHG emissions tallied in
 their debits.  +

 Dynamic â€“ This allows labor to be credited without attaching a
 debit to any object or person. Debited objects may also remain
 uncompensated-for, and people can accumulate debit without a
 corresponding credit being generated.
